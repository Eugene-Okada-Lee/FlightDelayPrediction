Modeling Research Project in R
– Analyzed and compared two models of prediction, Logit-Lasso (Linear Regression) and Random Forest (Tree
Classification), which were developed using K-fold cross validation and evaluated using F-measurement tests.
– Compiled the data set using scraping tools in R to process data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and
the National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA)

Files included are:
1.  R code with modeling practice
